h1. Nunjucks

I'm tired of the lack of good templating systems for large js apps. EJS is ugly and is missing a lot, mustache is great but not for large server-side templates, I could go on and on.

I hope that Nunjucks can be better. It is heavily jinja2 inspired because I think it is a great solution for templating. Nunjucks does not claim to be a direct port of jinja2, but most things will work the same in both projects.

This is very early code. The parser is mostly complete but the code generator is just beginning and does not work yet. You can play around with the parser with this:


bc..
    var parser = require('./parser');
    var nodes = require('./nodes');
    var n = parser.parse("Hello {{ username }}! {% if sick %}Feel better!{% endif %}")
    nodes.printNodes(n);

That will give you a nicely formatted print out of the AST generated from the parser.
