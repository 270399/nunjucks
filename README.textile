h1. Nunjucks

I'm tired of the lack of good templating systems for large js apps. The biggest missing feature between all of them is template inheritance, something necessary for a non-trivial site. Other problems is the ugliness of embedding javascript, too much logic in templates, etc.

I hope that Nunjucks can be better. It is heavily jinja2 inspired because I think it is a great solution for templating. Nunjucks does not claim to be a direct port of jinja2, but most things will work the same in both projects.

h2. Using

Here is an example template that works with the current code:
 
bc.. {# base.html #}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>{{ title }}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    {% block content %}{% endblock %}
  </body>
</html>

---

{# index.html, inherits base.html #}
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}

{# Variables and filters #}
Hello {{ name|title }}!

{# Call a function #}
{{ messages() }}

{# Conditionals #}    
{% if sick %}
  no
{% elif throwing %}
  THROWING UP?!
{% elif pooping %}
  STOP POOPING
{% else %}
  GOOD!
{% endif %}

{# For iteration #}
<p>
  Let's print some numbers:
  <ul>
  {% for i in [1,2,3,4,5] %}
   <li>{{ i }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</p>

{% endblock %}

p. To compile templates, you can create a Template directly or load one from an environment object. Right now the environment just loads the template from the disk relative to the current location.

bc.. var e = require('./environment');
var tmpl = new e.Template('Hello {{ username }}');
console.log(tmpl.render({ username: "james" }));

// From an environment
var env = new e.Environment();
var tmpl = env.get_template('test.html');
console.log(tmpl.render({ username: "james" }));

h2. Express

To integrate with express, do the following (this will change before the first release):

bc.. var loaders = require('../src/loaders');
var express = require('express');

var e = new env.Environment(new loaders.FileSystemLoader('templates'));
app.engine('html', e.express());

h2. Status

This is very close to a 0.1 beta release. It is mostly feature-complete with all the basic stuff ported from Jinja. There are a few things left:

* Implement the "include" tag
* Allow referencing: {{ foo.bar }} and {{ foo["bar"] }}
* Better express integration
* Write more tests, fix bugs
